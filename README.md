## How to run a benchmark

In order to run a benchmark, one needs to execute the following command:
`smlb`. It takes a few parameters. The first one is for telling which model to
run. Supported models can be listed through the help options: `smlb --help`.
See the `Commands:` section at the end of the output. Each of the models should
have an option for supported frameworks. This can also be checked through the
`--help` option. This time however, you need to list the help for the model.
For example: `smlb transformer --help`. Look at the `Commands:` again.
